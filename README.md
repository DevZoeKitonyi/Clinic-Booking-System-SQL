### Creating a Custom GitHub README.md

I'll help you create a professional GitHub README.md file based on the clinic booking system example you shared. Here's a complete README that incorporates all the elements from your screenshots:

```markdown project="Clinic Booking System" file="README.md"
...
```

### 2. Open MySQL and Import the Database

You can import the SQL schema and data using the MySQL command-line tool or any GUI like MySQL Workbench.

#### Option A: Using MySQL CLI

```shellscript
mysql -u root -p &lt; clinic_booking_system.sql
```

#### Option B: Using MySQL Workbench

1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Connect to your server
3. Open `clinic_booking_system.sql`
4. Execute the full script


## üîí Roles & Permissions

The system uses MySQL roles to manage permissions:

| Role | Permissions
|-----|-----
| admin | Full access to the database
| developer | Full access (for development/testing purposes)
